## About The Project

[![Mercadito Libre Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://macamonper.github.io/mercadito/)

This repository is a project made for ADA. I used Mercado Libre website as an example to practice my recent knlowledge of APIS and SASS.
In this website you can search a product and also apply various filters and sorts. It´s also possible to search products by the categories that Mercado Libre´s API has set.
You can see the information of the products and a detailed version of the selected product when clicked.
